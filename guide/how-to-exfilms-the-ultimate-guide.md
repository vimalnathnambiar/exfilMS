# How to ExfilMS: The Ultimate Guide

> *Note: If you are reading this guide, it is assumed that you have ExfilMS already installed and is available on your machine. If it is not installed, please refer to the installation guide [here](../README.md#installation).*

ExfilMS is a cross-platform, command line application that allows you to easily extract MS data from mzML files into JSON formatted output files, with spectrum filtering capability. This guide will help you understand the accepted parameters that can be configured for the extraction/filtering of MS data to suit your analytical needs.

There are two primary ways to use ExfilMS: 
1. [Command Line](#command-line)
2. [Interactive Mode](#interactive-mode)

Let's begin!

## Command Line

## Interactive Mode

Extending the command line input, you can easily initiate ExfilMS in an interactive mode. This mode will trigger different input prompts that will guide you through the parameter configuration process. 

To use interactive mode, simply run `exfilms` with the `--interactive` flag in your terminal:

```md
# To use ExfilMS in interactive mode
$ exfilms --interactive
```
