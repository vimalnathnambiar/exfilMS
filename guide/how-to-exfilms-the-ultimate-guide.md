# How to ExfilMS: The Ultimate Guide

> *Note: If you are reading this guide, it is assumed that you have ExfilMS already installed and is available on your machine. If it is not installed, please refer to the installation guide [here](../README.md#installation).*

ExfilMS is a cross-platform, command line application that allows you to easily extract MS data from mzML formatted files into JSON, with spectrum filtering capabilities. This guide will help you understand how to use ExfilMS to its full potential. 

Once ExfilMS has been installed on your local machine, the ExfilMS process can be initiated through the execution of simple, easy-to-use command line prompts upon installation. There are currently two ways of executing ExfilMS: 
1. [Command Line Flags](#command-line-flags)
2. [Interactive Mode](#interactive-mode)

To use interactive mode, simply run `exfilms` with the `--interactive` flag in your terminal:
